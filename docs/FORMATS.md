# IGI 1 data formats

What we know, how sure we are, and where the reader lives. All integers are little-endian.
Confidence: **confirmed** = parser runs over every file of that type in a full install; **partial** = some
fields understood; **unknown** = only the magic is known.

Reference install: the English PC release (`IGI.exe`, 1,384,448 bytes), 1,940 files, ~400 MB.

## Overview

| ext | count | MB | magic | status | reader |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| .res | 92 | 274.5 | `ILFF` / `IRES` | confirmed (container) | `src/formats/ilff.ts` |
| .wav | 394 | 47.1 | `ILSF` | unknown | |
| .dat | 317 | 35.2 | `0xccddeeff` / text | unknown | |
| .tex | 26 loose + ~6,900 in archives | 7.2 | `LOOP` | v11 confirmed | `src/formats/tex.ts` |
| .lmp / .cmd / .ctr / .hmp / .bit | 14 / 14 / 14 / 6 / 14 | ~21 | none | unknown (terrain set, one per level) | |
| .iff | 6 | 5.2 | `FORM` / `BOBJ` | unknown (animations) | |
| .qvm | 997 | 3.7 | `LOOP` (v8) | unknown (compiled script) | |
| .mef | ~6,900 in archives | | `ILFF` / `OCEM` | unknown (models) | |
| .olm | ~25,000 in archives | | none | unknown (per-object lightmaps) | |
| .mtp | 17 | 0.4 | `FORM` / `MTP ` | unknown (material table?) | |
| .fnt | 2 + in archives | | `ILFF` / `FONT` | unknown | |
| .avi | 5 | 2.4 | `RIFF` | standard AVI | browser / ffmpeg |

Per-level layout: `missions/location0/levelN/` holds `models/levelN.res`, `textures/levelN.res`,
`lightmaps/lightmaps.res`, `terrain/terrain.*`, `ai/*.qvm` (one per AI actor id), `graphs/graph*.dat`
(AI navigation graphs, presumably), `objects.qvm` (object placement) and `mission.qvm`.
Shared assets live in `missions/location0/common/` and `common/`.

## ILFF container (confirmed)

```
file   := "ILFF" u32 fileSize  u32 align  u32 reserved  tag4 formType  pad-to-align  chunk*
chunk  := tag4 u32 length  u32 align  u32 next  u8[length]
```

- `fileSize` equals the file length.
- `align` is 4 in most files and 32 in some archives (e.g. `common/textures/common.res`). The first chunk begins
  at the 20-byte header rounded up to `align`.
- `next` is the distance from this chunk's header to the next chunk's header; `0` ends the list.
- Used by archives (`IRES`), models (`OCEM`) and fonts (`FONT`).

### IRES archive

A flat list of `NAME` + `BODY` pairs. `NAME` is a NUL-terminated virtual path such as
`LOCAL:models/003_01_3.mef`. `BODY` is the file's bytes. The `LOCAL:` prefix appears to be relative to the
archive's mission folder; shared archives use paths like `LOCAL:common/sounds/...`.

Open questions:
- The `language/*/*.res` archives contain no `BODY` chunks (different chunk tags, probably string tables).
- 232 entries in `common/textures/common.res` start with four zero bytes rather than a known magic.

## .tex texture, v11 (confirmed for v11)

```
 0  "LOOP"
 4  u32 version              11 in all mission archives; 2 in loose common/textures/*.tex (24-byte header)
 8  u16 format               2 = 16-bit ARGB1555, no mips
                              67 (0x40 | 3) = 32-bit ARGB8888 followed by a full mip chain to 1x1
10  u8[10] zero
20  u16 unknown              5 in every file seen
22  u16 width, u16 height
26  u16 width, u16 height    repeated; never seen to differ
30  u16 bytesPerPixel        2 or 4
32  pixels, row-major from the top-left
```

Sizes check out exactly: format 2 is `32 + w*h*2`; format 67 is `32 + 4 * sum(mip sizes)`.
ARGB8888 is stored as B, G, R, A bytes. Filenames of 32-bit textures end in `_argb8888`.

## ILSF sound (partial)

```
0  "ILSF"
4  u16 codec?       1 in common/sounds, 2 in mission dialogue (payload of 2 does not look like PCM)
6  u16 bits         16
8  u32 channels     1
12 u32 sampleRate   22050
16 u32 dataSize
20 data
```

## .qvm compiled script (unknown)

`LOOP`, u32 version 8, then a table of offsets, followed by a string pool containing function names such as
`DefineAmmoType`. Next step: map the header table to string pool / code / constants.
